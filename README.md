# Profile page

I completed that simple challenge during my time at Le Wagon.

The purpose was to start manipulating HTML tags, using CSS selectors and web-design resources for fonts and colors, and to create a responsive profile card with headers, text, lists, and images. Eventually, putting it online using  [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
